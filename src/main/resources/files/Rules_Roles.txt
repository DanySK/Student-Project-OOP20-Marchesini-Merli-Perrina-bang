
EACH PLAYER HAS A ROLE, WHICH DETERMINES WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO WIN.

SHERIFF: kill the outlaws and the renegade.
DEPUTY: help the sheriff, kill the outlaws and the renegade.
OUTLAW: kill the sheriff.
RENEGADE: kill everyone and be the last one standing.

The game ends when either the SHERIFF or the RENEGADE and the OUTLAWS are dead.
